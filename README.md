To create your own copy of this repository:
    Fork the GitHub repository (in the link above) to make a copy of it to your GitHub account. You can do this by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right.
    This opens a new page where you can retitle your copy of the repository.
    Once you've completed forking the repository, be sure you're looking at your copy (and not the original). Click the green "Code" button, select the Local Clone type (SSH), and click the copy button (two overlapping squares icon) to copy your repository address.
    Go to your IDE terminal or your computer terminal (Make sure you're in the proper directory for where you want to create and store files for your work). Then run git clone <repository> where "<repository>" is replaced with the repository address you copied in the last step.
